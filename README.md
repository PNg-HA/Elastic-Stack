# Elastic Stack
My ELK stack, referenced by elastic.co website

Elastic Stack, also known as ELK Stack, is a stack that comprises of three popular projects: 

* Elasticsearch
* Logstash
* Kibana
 
and other components such as:
- Beat
- APM

Elastic Stack is used to take data from any source then search by Elasticsearch, analyze and visualize by Kibana. In this repository, I will only go into detail about Elasticsearch and Kibana.

## Components
### Elasticsearch
### Kibana

## Setup
### Host requirements
* [Docker Engine][docker-install] version **18.06.0** or newer
* [Docker Compose][compose-install] version **1.26.0** or newer (including [Compose V2][compose-v2])
* More than **6 GB** of RAM (because the host consumes lots of memory when runs ELK multi nodes)
### Setup steps
> **Summary**  
> This document will show how to use Docker and Docker Compose to install 3 
> Elasticsearch nodes in 1 cluser, Kibana to visual and management them, and how to backup 
> and restore the database. The way to install is the final, after hours of fixing bugs during the installation.
> The **demo** is at [here](https://www.youtube.com).

  1. In a Ubuntu server, create a directory and move into it:

	
    $ mkdir docker-ELK && cd $_
    
	
  2. Make a `docker-compose.yml`file with the contents from [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml)

   > **Note**  
   > This file is at first referenced from the [docker-compose file][docker-compose-file] of [elastic.co], however I have edited it to fix bugs when build the 
   > docker
   > compose up. What I have edited is setting up JVM heap size in `environment` tag `- ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms750m -Xmx750m` in each Elasticsearch node, which
   > prevents the nodes from exiting.

  3. Create `.env` file with the contents from [`.env`](.env)

   > **Note**  
   > This file is at first referenced from the [.env file][.env-file] of [elastic.co], however I have edited it. Beside `password` and `version`, I have also 
   > edited 
   > `MEM_LIMIT` = **6442450944** bytes, which is more than **6 GB**.

  4. Increase the limit of `mmap` (virtual memory of the host):

	$ sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=524288
	
  5. At the docker-ELK directory, run the command:
	
	$ docker compose up -d 

   Wait for about 3 minutes for the ELK to setup.
   > **Note**  
   > If there are problems, run `$ docker compose logs -f <service>` to observe the logs and exit code (search google for it). If you meet the **137** exit 
   > code, I recommend [this][exit-code-137] .
 
  6. When all 3 nodes are healthy, access the Kibana web UI by opening http://IP-address-of-the-host:5601 in a web browser and use the following (default) credentials to log in:

	user: elastic
	password: abc123 

## Backup and restore
### Backup
	
  1. Display the list of ELK containers:
	
	$docker ps
	
  2. Access to **each** container with `root`:

	$docker exec -u 0 -it <esearch container id> /bin/bash
	$apt-get update
	
  3. Install the `nano` text editor:
	
	$apt-get install nano
	
  4. `Ctrlâ€“D` to quit the container and get access to it again with user elasticsearch:

	docker exec -it <esearch container id> /bin/bash

  5. Create a backup directory:
	
	mkdir backup_repo

  6. Config the `elasticsearch.yml` file to create a path to the backup directory:

	nano config/elasticsearch.yml

  7. Add `path.repo: /usr/share/elasticsearch/backup_repo` to the file. Save the file with `Ctrl-S` and exit with `Ctrl-X`.
  > **Note**  
  > To know the location of directory `backup_repo`, use command `pwd`
  
Do these above steps for **3** elasticsearch node. Then go to the Kibana web UI. 

  1. Go to **Stack Management** -> **Snapshot and Restore** -> **Repositories**

  2. Select **Register repository**. 
  3. Name **Repository name** as `demo`.
  4. At **Repository type**, select **Shared file system** and Next.

  5. At the `File system locatio`, type: `/usr/share/elasticsearch/backup_repo`. Ignore other fields and **Save**.

  6. Then move to **Policies** -> **Create policy**
  7. At step 1, **Logistics**, type as your choice and **Next**.

  8. At step 2, **Snapshot settings**, in **Data streams and indices**, choose only my index: favor_candy 
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93396414/199720039-dba0cd14-c73b-409f-bb77-da08e789a58d.png)

   > **Note** 
   > If the **Include global state** show up, then turn on it.
   Then **Next**. 
   9. Step 3 is not important in this document. I only set the Maximum count to 4. Then **Next**.
   
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93396414/199720548-f2b418f6-6f72-4338-b6b4-39925593b373.png)
   
   10. At step 4, **Review**, check again.
   
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93396414/199720718-10ef5b4f-f0cd-44a1-9dc5-4748402b2939.png)
   
   If nothing to edit, then **Create policy**.
   11. A pop-up show up, choose **run now**
   
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93396414/199721156-c801d522-267b-4f82-8c7a-f53d23b0604c.png)
   
   The successful snapshot will look like this:

### Restore:

> **Note**  
> Elastic has strict rules about restoring indices. It will not allow to restore system files unless they are deleted. This part will restore the indices that > I have written in `Dev Tools`
