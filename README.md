# Elastic Stack
My ELK stack, referenced by elastic.co website

Elastic Stack, also known as ELK Stack, is a stack that comprises of three popular projects: 

* Elasticsearch
* Logstash
* Kibana
 
and other components such as:
- Beat
- APM

Elastic Stack is used to take data from any source then search by Elasticsearch, analyze and visualize by Kibana. In this repository, I will only go into detail about Elasticsearch and Kibana.
